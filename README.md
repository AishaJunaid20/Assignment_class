# ✅ Task Manager App

Welcome to my **Task Manager** project! This is a simple and interactive to-do app built using **Streamlit** and follows the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. It helps you stay organized and keep track of your daily tasks easily!

## 🚀 What this app does:

- ➕ Add new tasks  
- 📋 Display all added tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as completed  
- ❌ Delete completed tasks  
- 💻 Clean and interactive interface

## 🧠 What makes it different?

- This app is built using **OOP concepts**:
  - A `TaskManager` class handles all task-related logic.
  - It makes the code more **organized**, **modular**, and **reusable**.
  - Helps you understand how to use **classes and objects** in real projects.

## 🛠️ How it works:

- The app uses a **Python script** with **Streamlit** to create a user interface.
- Users can enter a task using a text box.
- Tasks are handled by methods inside a custom class.
- Buttons let users **add**, **view**, and **delete** tasks.
- Task list updates instantly after each action.

## 📂 Files included:

- `main.py` → Main file to run the app (with OOP code)
- `README.md` → You're reading it!

## ▶️ How to Run:

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install Streamlit using:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit

3. Run the app with:

streamlit run task_manager.py



The app will open in your browser automatically!

✨ Future Improvements (optional):

Add task deadlines or priority levels

Save tasks permanently using a database or file

Add user login system for personal task lists

This is one of my early projects as I explore Python, OOP, and building real-world apps.
